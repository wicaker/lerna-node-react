# LERNA NODE REACT

- `npx lerna boostrap` to install all depedency (if not work, just jump to specific folder)

- /packages/fake-server-db (`yarn install` and `yarn mock:api`)

- /packages/node-server (`yarn install` and `yarn watch`)

- /packages/product (`yarn install`, `yarn build`, and `yarn start`)

just for fun :D (need more to learn)
